The following questions were on various usages of the RLIKE, NOT RLIKE, and REVERSE operators, something I'm learning for the first time and were very useful!

1. Weather Observation Station 6

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY LIKE 'A%' OR CITY LIKE'E%' OR CITY LIKE'I%' OR CITY LIKE'O%' OR CITY LIKE'U%'  
 
Comments: This code worked but it seemed very long and an ineffective way to solve this problem. After going through w3resource website,
I figured an easier way to solve this: 

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY RLIKE '^[aeiou]'

2. Weather Observation Station 7

SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION 
WHERE REVERSE(CITY) RLIKE '^[aeiou]'

3. Weather Observation Station 8

SELECT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY RLIKE '^[AEIOU]'
AND REVERSE(CITY) RLIKE '^[aeiou]'

4. Weather Observation Station  9

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE CITY NOT RLIKE '^[AEIOU]'

5. Weather Observation Station 10

SELECT DISTINCT CITY 
FROM STATION 
WHERE REVERSE(CITY) NOT RLIKE '^[aeiou]'
