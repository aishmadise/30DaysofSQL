Q1. https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10285-acceptance-rate-by-date 

My Answer: 
SELECT a.date,
count(b.user_id_receiver)/count(a.user_id_receiver) as acceptance_rate
FROM
  (SELECT date, user_id_sender,
                user_id_receiver
   FROM fb_friend_requests
   WHERE action='sent' ) a
LEFT JOIN
  (SELECT date, user_id_sender,
                user_id_receiver
   FROM fb_friend_requests
   WHERE action='accepted' ) b ON a.user_id_sender=b.user_id_sender
AND a.user_id_receiver=b.user_id_receiver
GROUP BY a.date
ORDER BY a.date DESC



Q2. https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10353-workers-with-the-highest-salaries

My Answer: 

SELECT b.worker_title
FROM worker a 
INNER JOIN title b 
on a.worker_id = b.worker_ref_id
WHERE salary IN (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM worker)

Few comments: I noticed that in the solution for this question uses case when which is not necessary but good to know. However, I really like someone's solution I came 
across where you dont have to use joins to arrive at the right answer. I'm not sure if it improves performance though.  

ALternate answer: 

SELECT worker_title 
FROM title 
WHERE worker_ref_id IN (SELECT worker_id FROM worker WHERE salary = (SELECT max(salary) FROM worker))
